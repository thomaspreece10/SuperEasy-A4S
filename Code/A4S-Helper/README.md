#A4S-Helper App

##What does it do?
This is the nice looking GUI that shows the user instructions and the 3 Step guide. It doesn't do anything complicated itself but hides the complexity of the other programs bundled with SuperEasy-A4S by running them with the correct parameters. If your looking to add new features to SuperEasy-A4S you probably are looking in the wrong folder. You will only need to edit this if there is a problem with the friendly user interface.

##Language?
[BlitzMax] (http://www.blitzmax.com/)

##Building?
To build you will need to have a license for BlitzMax and have also downloaded and compiled the following extra modules: 
[wxmax](https://code.google.com/p/wxmax/)
[serial.mod] (https://github.com/maxmods/bah.mod)
[regex.mod] (https://github.com/maxmods/bah.mod)
[volumes.mod] (https://github.com/maxmods/bah.mod)

Due to the fact BlitzMax isn't free, precompiled versions of the program for Mac OSX and Windows are included in the source.
